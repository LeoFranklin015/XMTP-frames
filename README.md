# RollTheDice



## Description
RollTheDice is a frame built using open frame meta tags. It is also compatible with Farcaster frames.

Users can enter a number between 1 to 6 and roll a virtual dice. If the rolled number matches the chosen number, the user wins; otherwise, they lose. It's a fun and easy way to pass the time and test your luck!

## Future Integrations
1. **Betting on the Roll**: In future updates, users will be able to place bets on the roll. By utilizing a transactions button, users can wager on the outcome of the dice roll. If the user wins, the prize will be increased and returned to the user. This feature adds an exciting element of risk and reward to the game. Stay tuned for updates!
